An abridged history of my most significant experiences with 
programming languages, in somewhat chronological order 

**Python** 
- My first language. 
- Not much to say. It was a good first language. but 
  I eventually moved on when I wanted to write 
  GUIs. Tk was intimidating
  
**Java** 
- Love the libraries
- Hated how it forced you to program in a very abstraction 
  heavy way, often wondered "where do you put the code 
  that...does stuff?"
    
**Web Languages: (PHP/JavaScript/etc)** 
- I loved the freedom that those languages gave me. 
- This + the relative transparency of the
  browser programming environment + the amount of documentation 
  out there allowed me to really improve at "Getting Things Done."
- At the same time, that freedom brought out 
  some of my worst traits as a programmer. 
  Had a lot of bad experiences maintaining said code.  
  
**C**  
- Loved C because the way you programmed exposed more 
  of what was really happening. I tend to be a bottom up 
  thinker so I really enjoyed this. 
- C had this element of 'you have to pay attention or else
  you'll fuck up' that's really engaging. 
- Hated Make. Hated pthreads. Hated trying to use any
  library that I didn't write myself. Eventually got burned 
  so hard by C at an internship that I considered quitting 
  the field all together. Yeah...
  
**C++**
- I used C++ with Qt for a Computer Graphics class
  and I actually loved it. 
- Basically everything I loved about C with everything 
  I loved about Java. 
- I'd avoided C++ due to the complexity, but when anchored
  to a powerful library its kind of neat. 

## Languages I'm currently Learning

**Go**
- Love the fact that it prioritizes (enforces?) programming 
  in a simple, K&R-esque style 
- Love its extensive builtin networking/backend development libraries
  and features.
- Much more comfortable for me than most high level languages 
- No issues with it so far. 

**Rust**
- I was initially skeptical about Rust due to  its C++ - like complexity,
  but the more I learn  about it, the more I'm thinking that it could fulfill much
  of my needs of a language [as a backend/systems developer]. 
- The language is weird because on paper it connects all of the things I've enjoyed across very different languages,  but it also has the complexity that I've been running from for years. Either way, I'm looking forward to figuring out what it *really* is.  
    
To be honest, as I learn more about Rust, Go starts to look less interesting, 
but I still love that language too. The futures looking bright
for a backend/systems developer :)
